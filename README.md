# Getting-started-with-tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. Tmux allows a number of terminals  each running a separate program, to be created and used inside a session. It allows switching between multiple programs in one terminal, detach them and reattach them to a different terminal.

As tmux sessions are presistent, programs running in Tmux will continue to run even if you get disconnected.


### Installation of tmux
#### On Ubuntu and Debian
```$ sudo apt install tmux```

#### On Fedora and CentOS
```$ sudo yum install tmux```

#### On MacOS
```$ brew install tmux```
